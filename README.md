# Spectacle

Spectacle allows you to easily organize your windows without using a mouse.

# Requirements

Spectacle has been built, and designed, for OS X 10.7 or later. Xcode 4.6 is recommended for building the project.

Those building Spectacle only need [ZeroKit] [2], which can be pulled down as a submodule with the following commands:

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

If everything is in its proper place the build should succeed.

Those wishing to contribute to the project should begin by obtaining the latest source with Git. The project is hosted on GitHub, making it easy for anyone to make contributions. Simply create a fork and make your changes.
