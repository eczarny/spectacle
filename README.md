# Spectacle

Spectacle allows you to easily organize your windows without using a mouse.

# Requirements

Spectacle has been built, and designed, for Mac OS X 10.6 or later.

In order to build Spectacle you will need to install [Sparkle] [1]. Please download and install Sparkle to:

    /Library/Frameworks/

Next, pull down [ZeroKit] [2] as a submodule with the following commands:

If everything is in its proper place the Xcode build should succeed.
